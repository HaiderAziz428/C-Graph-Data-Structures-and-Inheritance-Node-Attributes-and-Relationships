## Project Overview

In the world of social networks, representing the connections between people is essential. This project focuses on modeling social networks as graphs, with individuals as nodes and relationships between them as edges. It provides a framework for creating, managing, and enhancing graph nodes with various attributes.

## File Structure

The project is organized as follows:

SimpleGraph.cpp and SimpleGraph.h: Implement the SimpleGraph class for basic graph functionality.
SimpleNode.cpp and SimpleNode.h: Implement the SimpleNode class for node-specific functionality.
AttributedGraph1.cpp and AttributedGraph1.h: Define AttributedGraph1, a subclass of SimpleGraph that adds age and gender attributes to nodes.
AttributedGraph2.cpp and AttributedGraph2.h: Define AttributedGraph2, another subclass of SimpleGraph that adds profession and location attributes to nodes.
main.cpp: Contains the main program to demonstrate the functionality of the classes.
Class Descriptions
SimpleGraph: Represents a basic graph with nodes and relationships.
SimpleNode: Represents a node in the graph, with methods for adding edges and managing neighbors.
AttributedGraph1: Extends SimpleGraph to include age and gender attributes for nodes.
AttributedGraph2: Extends SimpleGraph to include profession and location attributes for nodes.

## Usage

Compile the project using a C++ compiler.
Run the compiled program to create graph nodes, add relationships, and manage attributes.
Use the provided functions to access and manipulate the graph and its attributes.
For a more detailed usage guide, please refer to the code comments and the main.cpp file.
